This is an example pipeline and data using bioshake to align and call variants.
The fastq files are simulated from the reference and included in this directory.
Note that the simulated reads don't contain any variants, so the resulting vcf
file should be empty. You can run the sample pipeline by:

  runhaskell simple.lhs *.fq

or by compiling then executing the resulting binary on the fastq files. If you
are using stack you can:

  stack setup
  stack build
  stack runhaskell simple.lhs *.fq
